# A Simple_Chatty_Bot in JAVA (Hyperskill Project)

# About

--> Here, at the beginning of your programmer’s path, creating a simple console chat bot will do wonders to guide you through the basics of    coding. During this journey you will also play some word and number games that you are going to implement all on your own. Pack up and      let’s hit the road, my friend!
